3-part Coding Challenge - NOTES
----------------------------------

2. Add an input field to the HTML where players can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100. This is a good opportunity to use Google to build some coding skills you haven't yet learned. (HINT: You can read that value with the JS .value property.)

- AFTER USER SELECTS New Game:
-- Add message text, input field, and submit button to the game board, centered below New Game control.
**!! Put this in the Init Function as default behavior !!**
<!--
"Enter the score you'll play up to." <-- message text
"100" <-- input field default
"Submit" + https://ionicons.com/v2/ <-- submit button text and icon
-->
** Enhance by putting this in a message/alert popup or modal.

- AFTER USER SUBMITS the winning score threshold:
-- Remove the input field and submit button.
-- Display the winning score threshold (WST) for reference.
<!--
"1st player to NUM wins!" <-- message text above Roll Dice control
-->

In app.js, score is "set" by comparing if activePlayer has met/exceeded someValue (>= someValue) within the Hold Score Event Listener. someValue was originally hard-coded into the game at this point.
- Use value, from the input field or WST reference, to dynamically set the winning score threshold per game.

----------------------------------

3. Add another dice to the game so that there are two different dice visible. A player now looses their current score when one of the dice rolls a 1. (HINT: You will need CSS to position the 2nd dice, so take a look at the CSS code for the first one.)

- [x] Add another dice <img> into HTML.

- [x] Adjust the CSS so dice are positioned next to each other across breakpoints.

- In app.js
-- In Roll Dice event listener
- [x] Relearn how var dice = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1; works.
- [x] Will you need two variables (or an array??) for this to store and display the rolls for each discreet die?
- [] Add both dice together so current and global scores don't display multiple values.
- [] Taking the above into account, determine how to check if either of the dice in a roll === 1.
- [] Taking the above into account, does the round and global scoring still work as expected?
- [] Taking the above into account, does the "rolled two 6's in a row" logic still work as expected?
